# Pathfinding Android App

This is an Android application that uses an **A\*** pathfinding algorithm to calculate and visualize the shortest path on a map. The app processes uploaded map images, enables users to set start and end points, and calculates a path while ensuring paths stay in the center of walkable areas.

## Features
- **Upload Map**: Upload a Black and White iamge of a map to process.
- **Interactive Point Selection**: Choose start and end points by tapping on the screen.
- **Proximity-Aware Pathfinding**: Paths avoid walls and narrow spaces, favoring central walkable areas.
- **Path Visualization**: Display the calculated path directly on the uploaded map.
- **Customizable Maps**: Support for different map images and grid representations.
